# Neuron App

This is a portal which collects all the latest Neuron Apps.

**Neuron App** is one of the most important features of ADLINK **Neuron SDK** which provides you the reference design of classic AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot) applications. You can download the source codes and develop it by using **Neuron IDE**.
